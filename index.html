        <h2>What is Ruby.</h2>

<p>Ruby as any other object oriented programming language, resembles a natural world everything is an Object and there are integers, characters, text, arrays - everything.
You put yourself in the place of an object and then do stuff related to other objects or oneself.</p>

<p>'self' defines the code to specify who you are., if we do not specify the class the default is 'main'.</p>

<p>Operating with objects:
Ruby uses period to call any method over any object and the resultant is again another object.</p>

<p>Ruby shows us all the methods if we just need to check them, typing Object.methods returns all the methods separated by ':' </p>

<h3>Hand On Code</h3>

<p>Using some hand crafted examples just to understand the language basics. </p>

<ul>
<li>Printing Hello world!
<code>
     #puts "how about this"
     puts "Hello World!"
     puts "Hello Again"
     puts "I like typing this!"
     puts "This is fun"
     puts "Yay! printing"
     puts "I'd much rather you not"
     puts 'I "said" I do not touch this'
</code>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything that starts with a '#' would be acting as comments
`
  # A comment is there so that the programe could be read later
  # Anything after # is ignored by ruby</p>

<p>puts "I could have code like this" # and a comment after that</p>

<p># we can also use comment to ignore the line of code may be
  # puts "this won't get printed"
`</p>
</li>
